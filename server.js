//useNewUrlParser - The underlying MongoDB driver has deprecated their current connection string parser. Because this is a major change, they added the useNewUrlParser flag to allow users to fall back to the old parser if they find a bug in the new parser. You should set useNewUrlParser: true unless that prevents you from connecting. Note that if you specify useNewUrlParser: true, you must specify a port in your connection string, like mongodb://localhost:27017/dbname. The new url parser does not support connection strings that do not have a port, like mongodb://localhost/dbname.
//useFindAndModify - True by default. Set to false to make findOneAndUpdate() and findOneAndRemove() use native findOneAndUpdate() rather than findAndModify().
